# Function Calling Agent

Agent developers can build agents with many different architectures. But we believe that any project involving the development of an agent should always start from the same place: that is, validating whether or not a simple **Function Calling Agent** is able to meet the requirements of the desired use cases.

All agent architectures likely call some functions or tools. So what does it mean to be a simple Function Calling Agent Architecture?

**Definition**: **Function Calling (FC)** is a capability offered out of the box by most chat tuned or instruction tuned models. In this architecture, each model can select from a set of functions or tools to aid in information collection, before responding to the end user query.

In its most basic incarnation, an FC Agent is nothing more than:

- An LLM informed about a toolkit or function set.
- A program able to execute the function or tools from the toolkit.

The flow for an FC Agent is:

1. A user sends a query to the FC Agent.
2. The FC Agent routes the query to the LLM.
3. The LLM responds with either:
    1. a final answer; then the answer is sent back to the user. Done!
    2. or a tool to use; then the program executes the tool.
4. Upon completion, the result of the tool execution is sent back to the LLM with the original query.
5. Repeat step 3 until a final answer is received.

A common misconception is that the LLM underlying the Agent is able to execute tools, when in fact the LLM is only selecting a tool and the tool parameters to execute based on the query. The tool execution is performed by the program supplementing the LLM invocations.

## Prerequisites

This lab is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). At the TechXchange lab, your workstation is already set up: there is nothing to install. To run it on your own machine or in Colab, complete the [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md) first.

## Lab

[![Function Calling Agent](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/github?icon=github&label=View%20on "View on GitHub")]({{ config.repo_url }}/blob/{{ extra.repo_branch }}/{{ notebook }}){:target="_blank"}
[![Function Calling Agent](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg "Open In Colab")]({{ extra.colab_url }}/blob/{{ extra.repo_branch }}/{{ notebook }}){:target="_blank"}

Open the notebook in the way that matches where you are working:

/// tab | Lab workstation

In JupyterLab, open `{{ notebook }}` from the file browser. If JupyterLab isn't running yet, see [At the TechXchange lab](../pre-work/README.md#at-the-techxchange-lab).

///

/// tab | Colab

Click **Open in Colab** above. The first code cell installs everything the notebook needs. Colab needs a Replicate API token: see [Running the Notebooks Remotely (Colab)](../pre-work/README.md#running-the-notebooks-remotely-colab).

///

/// tab | Your own machine

From the `granite-agent-workshop` folder you cloned in the [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md#clone-the-workshop-repository), with its virtual environment active, run:

```shell
jupyter notebook {{ notebook }}
```

///
