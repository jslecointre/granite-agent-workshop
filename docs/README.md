## Introduction

Welcome to IBM TechXchange Lab 1538. In this session you will build, test and observe AI agents using the open-source [IBM Granite](about-granite.md) 4.2 models.

An agent is a large language model that has been given tools and a loop: it decides which tool to call, your code runs it, the result goes back to the model, and the cycle repeats until the task is done. Everything you build today is a variation on that idea.

You will work through recipes from the [Granite Agent Cookbook](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-agent-cookbook) as Jupyter notebooks, on the lab workstation, on your own machine, or in Google Colab. You start with a simple Function Calling agent, then work through Plan-and-Solve, Route-and-Solve, ToolRAG and ReAct, learning when each pattern is worth its latency and token cost. You then instrument an agent with Langfuse so you can see every model call and tool call it makes.

/// tip | Getting started at the TechXchange lab
Your workstation is ready: nothing needs to be installed. Follow the five steps in [At the TechXchange lab](pre-work/README.md#at-the-techxchange-lab), then start with [1. Access the Model](part-01-access-the-model/README.md).

New to Granite? See [About Granite](about-granite.md) for a primer on the model family and the Granite 4.2 models this workshop runs on.

By the end of this workshop, you will learn about:

### 1. Access the Model

Connect to a Granite model, either on a local Ollama server or hosted on Replicate, and send it a first prompt. This is where you meet `get_llm()`, the small helper every notebook uses to pick a backend.

### 2. Building Agents

Five agent architectures, each in its own self-contained notebook. You start with a **Function Calling** agent, then work through **Plan-and-Solve**, **Route-and-Solve**, **ToolRAG** and **ReAct**, learning when each pattern is worth its extra latency and token cost.

### 3. Testing Agents

How to evaluate your agents and build an eval harness. Agents fail differently from ordinary software: the output can be fluent, confident and wrong, and the same input can take a different path on a different day. This part covers testing the trajectory as well as the final answer, scoring answers with LLM-as-a-Judge, and running it all on every change.

### 4. Observing Agents

Once an agent leaves your notebook, print statements stop being an option. This part covers instrumenting an agent with Langfuse so that every model call and tool call is recorded as a trace you can search, cost and analyze.

### 5. Packaging Agents

How to package an agent so other applications can call it, for example as an MCP server.

## About this workshop

The introductory page of the workshop is broken down into the following sections:

### Agenda

The workshop is organized into five parts, each covered by one or more Jupyter notebooks. Labs that are still being written are marked as coming soon.

There is deliberately more material here than most people finish in the 90-minute session, and that is fine: work at your own pace, or follow along as the instructors walk through each notebook. Every notebook stays published on this site, so you can finish the rest afterwards.
